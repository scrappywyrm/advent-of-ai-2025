    * Ice Fairy: "Ice Fairies are unrealistic and perpetuate harmful, impossible beauty standards."
* **The Pragmatist:**
    * Polar Bear: "A very large costume and the care and feeding of live bears is expensive. Can we clean it when it gets dirty?"

## PHASE 4 (Synthesis):

Tallying the votes:

* Yeti: 1
* Snowman: 1

We have a tie between Polar Bear and Ice Fairy.

Since there is a tie, we will have the Mediator choose between the remaining top choices.
The Mediator (Persona 6) chooses the Polar Bear. The justification is "The Polar Bear has both tradition and ecological concern. It would be my deciding vote."

**The Winner is Polar Bear.**
