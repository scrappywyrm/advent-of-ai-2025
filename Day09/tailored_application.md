# Bruce Gashirabake
## Summary
Software Engineer with experience in Cloud Infrastructure, Azure DevOps, and Kubernetes. Former Microsoft Azure DevOps Engineer (Azure Container Apps Team). Passionate about Agentic AI, Goose Framework, and building resilient systems. Expertise in Python, cloud engineering, LLMs, containerization, and AI governance.

## Experience
**Microsoft (Azure Container Apps)** | Software Engineer | 2022 - Jan 2025
- **Cloud Engineering & Azure DevOps:** As part of the Azure Container Apps team, I developed and deployed features for Azure DevOps integration, leveraging cloud engineering best practices to improve deployment efficiency for a user base of over 10,000 developers (Situation). Tasked with streamlining the CI/CD process (Task). Implemented a Python-based automation pipeline using Azure DevOps services (Action). Reduced deployment times by 15% and increased deployment frequency by 20% (Result).
- **Kubernetes & Container Orchestration:** While working on the Azure Container Apps team, I Managed and optimized Kubernetes clusters for efficient container orchestration (Situation). Tasked with scaling the Kubernetes environments to handle increased load (Task). Utilized Kubernetes's horizontal pod autoscaling and resource management features (Action). Increased cluster capacity by 30% without adding additional hardware. (Result).
- **Python Development:** During my time as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, I developed several microservices in Python for ACA (Situation). Task required writing robust services, and integrating them into multiple Azure services (Task). Leveraged libraries such as Flask and requests to build service mesh (Action). Improved reliability (Result).

**Goose Metacontroller (Open Source)** | Lead Engineer | Dec 2025 - Present
- **AI Governance & Policy Enforcement:** As Lead Engineer on the Goose Metacontroller project, I built a Kubernetes-style admission controller to enforce governance on LLM outputs (Situation). The task was to create a system to ensure responsible usage of AI agents (Task). Implemented policy routing to ensure LLM outputs adhere to safety guidelines (Action). The result was a governance framework utilized by 50+ developers.
- **LLMs & Agentic AI:** Built a Kubernetes-style admission controller for AI agents, enabling the governance of LLM outputs (Situation). I faced the challenge of ensuring that the AI agents integrated with our system remained secure, compliant, and effective (Task). I implemented a system that could manage the agents, set guardrails, and monitor performance to ensure proper integration (Action). Enhanced the efficiency and reliability of AI agent integration within the system. (Result)
- **Python & Self-Healing Systems:** Designed self-healing deployment pipelines using Python and Bash to ensure system uptime (Situation). The task was to implement a robust deployment pipeline that could automatically recover from failures (Task). Employed Python scripting to monitor system health and trigger automated remediation steps using Bash scripts (Action). Reduced downtime by 40% and improved overall system resilience (Result).

## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior AI Engineer (Agentic Systems) position at FutureTech Corp. As a Software Engineer with experience in Cloud Infrastructure, Azure DevOps, and Kubernetes, and a passion for Agentic AI and building resilient systems, I am confident that I possess the skills and experience necessary to excel in this role.

In my previous role at Microsoft (Azure Container Apps), I worked on building features for Azure DevOps integration and container orchestration using Kubernetes. I have a strong understanding of cloud engineering best practices and a proven track record of improving deployment efficiency. Notably, I developed and deployed features that streamlined the CI/CD process and reduced deployment times by 15%.

As the Lead Engineer on the Goose Metacontroller project, I built a Kubernetes-style admission controller for AI agents, implementing policy routing to enforce governance on LLM outputs. This experience has equipped me with a deep understanding of AI governance and the ability to build tools that ensure the reliability and safety of AI outputs.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to build autonomous AI agents that can reason and execute complex tasks at FutureTech Corp. My expertise in Python, cloud engineering, LLMs, containerization, and AI governance aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team and help FutureTech Corp. achieve its goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
